# A Camera Based Fire Detection System with added DHT and MQ135 for Air Quality Monitoring

The system we implemented is a mini version of our proposed final project with components provided by Samsung Innovation Campus Batch 6. This project uses a REST API for connecting the data that was retrieved from an ESP32 into Ubidots dashboard and a MongoDB database. We also used MQTT communication here for handling the data transfers between the ESP 32 CAM and the flask REST API for data transfers.
